        Each subplot represents all the in-text citations extracted from the full bodies of papers from one journal.
        A document is only counted if it contains at least one successfully parsed in-text citation.
        Note the most dramatic publisher, Social Indicators Research, which in last two decades has
            dramatically increased its publication volume, and thus its impact on our dataset and results.
        JSTOR provided data on the American Sociological Review (ASR) and the American Journal of Sociology (AJS)
            practically back to their founding.
        However, in-text citations were only recently institutionalized (around 1970).
        For this reason, any analysis I conduct with in-text citations from the JSTOR dataset
            will be limited to 1970-2010.

deadAuthors:

    name: Only five authors were forgotten
    desc:
        Kahl, Srole, Kerlinger, Scanzoni, and Spanier are the only five cited authors
            in the top 1% cited in a given decade which
            go on to die$_2$, die$_3$ or die$_5$.
        These authors all experienced the same dramatic rise and a just as dramatic demise.
        Near Kerlinger's death, Rowell (1997) wrote that Kerlinger argued against the 'practicallity myth' in education research,
            the assumption that research must be practically oriented.
        Rowell's survey of educational research textbooks showed that these ideas never made it into canon.

    desc:

        Cited terminology is distinct from cited authors or cited works in that they are hardly ever born after 1970
            (the beginning of reliable data from JSTOR).
        Trends in cited terms indicate not only what authors are talking about when they are using a citation,
            but also how they are writing.
        For instance, notice the dramatic trend of "research-also" and the steady trend of "would-expect".
        These turns of phrase are themselves cultural and intellectual objects, varying over time and social place,
            and for this reason I do not eliminate them from my analysis for the time being.

top1:
    name: Zooming in on the top 1%
    desc: 
        I would like to look at the most successful cited authors, cited works, and cited terms.
        Unfortunately, this isn't so simple. 
        There has been a dramatic increase in the supply of citations 
            over the last 100 years, 
            so the group with the most total citations would be skewed towards the citation preferences of recent papers.
        In order to account for this bias, 

        I choose among items cited by articles published in each decade 
            1940-1950, 1941-1951, 1942-1952, all the way to 1980-1990.
        In each of these decades I determine which were the top-cited 1%.
        The set of all these top 1%s, from all these decade spans, comprise the 1% I will study in this paper.

        Cultural phenomena are rich in meaning and context.
        Moreover, the meaning and context are what we care about, so stripping that would be a disservice.
        "Consider Geertz:"
        
        > Not only is the semantic structure of the figure a good deal more complex than it appears on the surface, but an analysis of that structure forces one into tracing a multiplicity of referential connections between it and social reality, so that the final picture is one of a configuration of dissimilar meanings out of whose interworking both the expressive power and the rhetorical force of the final symbol derive. (Geertz [1955] 1973, Chapter 8 Ideology as a Cultural System, p. 213)
        
        
        The way people understanding their world shape their action, and understandings are heterogeneous in any community, woven into a complex web of interacting pieces and parts.
        Understandings are constantly evolving, shifting with every conversation or Breaking News.
        Any quantitative technique for studying meaning must be able to capture the relational structure of cultural objects, their temporal dynamics, or it cannot be meaning.
        
        
        These considerations motivate how I have designed the data structure and code for this project.
        My attention to "cooccurrences" in what follows is an application of Levi Martin and Lee's (2018) formal approach to meaning.
        They develop the symbolic formalism I use below, as well as showing several general analytic strategies for inductive, ground-up meaning-making from count data.
        This approach is quite general, useful for many applications.
        
        
        The process is rather simple, I count cooccurrences between various attributes.
        For each document, for each citation in that document, I increment a dozen counters, depending on attributes of the citation, paper, journal, or author.
        This counting process is done once, and can be used as a compressed form of the dataset for all further analyses.
        In the terminology of Levi Martin and Lee, I am constructing "hypergraphs", and I will use their notation in what follows.
        For example $[c*fy]$ indicates the dataset which maps from $(c, fy) \to count$.
        
        $c$ is the name of the cited work.
        $fy$ is the publication year of the article which made the citation.
        $count$ is the number of citations which are at the intersection of these properties.
        
        
        + $[c]$ the number of citations each document receives
        
        + $[c*fj]$ the number of citations each document receives from each journal's articles
        
        + $[c*fy]$ the number of citations each document receives from each year's articles
        
        + $[fj]$ the number of citations from each journal
        
        + $[fj*fy]$ the number of citations in each journal in each year
        
        + $[t]$ cited term total counts
        
        + $[fy*t]$ cited term time series
        
        + term cooccurrence with citation and journal ($[c*t]$ and [fj*t]$)
        
        + "author" counts, the number of citations by each author ($[a]$ $[a*c]$ $[a*j*y]$)
        
        + [c*c]$, the cooccurrence network between citations
        
        + the death of citations can be studied using the $[c*fy]$ hypergraph
        
        + $[c*fj*t]$ could be used for analyzing differential associations of $c$ to $t$ across publication venues
        
        + $[ta*ta]$, $[fa*fa]$, $[t*t]$ and $[c*c]$ open the door to network-scientific methods
